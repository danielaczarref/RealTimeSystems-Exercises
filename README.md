# Real Time Systems - Exercises

Exercises proposed for the subject of Real Time Systems of the Computer Engineering major

First implemented exercise:

1) Create a multithreaded program to calculate the product of two square integer matrices of order 4. Sixteen threads must be created, each to calculate one of the sixteen elements of the resulting matrix.


Second implemented exercise:

2) Create a multithreaded program that performs a search for a number in a random vector of 100 integers. Four threads must be created and the vector must be populated with system-generated random integer numbers.
